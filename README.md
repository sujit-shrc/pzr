## Installation

Install `pzr` globally using `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
npm install -g pzr
# or
yarn global add pzr
```

> [!TIP]
> 
> Global installation allows you to use `pzr` from any directory on your system.

## Usage

### Initializing a Project

To initialize a new project or configure pzr for an existing project:

```bash
pzr init
```

This command will:

1. üîç Automatically detect your project type and configuration
2. üñ•Ô∏è Display the detected settings
3. ‚úÖ Prompt you to confirm or modify these settings

### Generating Files

Create new pages, routes, or components using the `create` command or its shorthand `-c`:

```bash
pzr create [pages...]
# or
pzr -c [pages...]
```

#### Examples

Create multiple pages:

```bash
pzr create home about contact
# or
pzr -c home about contact
```

Generate files in a specific directory:

```bash
pzr create -d dashboard/settings profile
# or
pzr -c -d dashboard/settings profile
```

> [!TIP]
> 
> You can create multiple pages/routes at once by listing them after the `create` command or `-c` flag.

## Project-Specific Usage

### Local Installation

If you prefer not to install `pzr` globally, use it on a per-project basis:

1. Install as a dev dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev pzr
   # or
   yarn add --dev pzr
   ```

2. Run `pzr` commands using `npx`:

   ```bash
   npx pzr init
   npx pzr -c home about
   ```

3. Alternatively, add scripts to your `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "pzr:init": "pzr init",
       "pzr:create": "pzr -c"
     }
   }
   ```

   Then use `npm` or yarn to run the commands:

   ```bash
   npm run pzr:init
   npm run pzr:create home about
   # or with yarn
   yarn pzr:init
   yarn pzr:create home about
   ```

### Via `npx` (without installation)

Use `pzr` without installation via npx:

```bash
npx pzr init
npx pzr -c home about
npx pzr -c -d dashboard/settings profile
```

> [!WARNING]
> 
> Using `npx` without installation may result in slower execution times as it downloads the package each time.

## Features

### üîç Automatic Project Configuration Detection

`pzr` intelligently detects:

- **Project Type**: Next.js, Express.js, or Vite React
- **Language**: TypeScript or JavaScript
- **Source Directory**: Whether you're using a `src` directory
- **Next.js Routing**: Page Router or App Router (for Next.js projects)

### üñ•Ô∏è User Confirmation Prompts

After detection, `pzr` will display the detected settings and prompt you to confirm or customize them, ensuring accuracy and flexibility.

### üìÅ Project-Specific File Generation

`pzr` file generation based on the project type:

- **Next.js**:

  - Generates `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, and `loader.tsx` in created routes in `/app` or `/src/app` dir.
  - Supports both Page Router and App Router structures and both `tsx` and `jsx` components.

- **Express.js**:

  - Creates models, controllers, and routes for `js` or `ts` apps.
  - Automatically adds `app.use(routeMiddleware)` in `app.ts`

- **Vite React**:
  - Generates `.jsx` or `.tsx` components in the `/components` directory

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> We're actively working on adding support for more project types!

## Configuration

pzr stores its configuration in a `.pzr-config.json` file in your project root. This file is created when you run `pzr init` and contains information about your project type, language preference, and other settings.

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> It's recommended to use the `pzr init` command to modify your configuration. Manual edits to `.pzr-config.json` may lead to unexpected behavior.
